Please install pyserial and matplotlib before running.

`git clone https://github.com/ReeceTho/RFA_Interview_Task

python RFA_Task_2.py`

Upon running, select emulation or read in the console.
If read is selected, input your serial port name in the console.

Code will then graphically display a plot of the read/emulation data. It will then save a pdf of the graph along with a CSV file of the readings all in the same directory as it is ran from.
